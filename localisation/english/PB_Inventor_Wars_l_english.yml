  inventorwar.1.t:0 "The Child of Light"
  inventorwar.1.d:0 "The Edison Imperial Electric Exposition was a place not known for tact or subtlety.\n\nEnormous plasticine lightbulbs flanked each side of a vast stage, while showgirls twirled about beneath the flickering bulbs of the press corps. Scandelously clad waitresses toured through the crowd, handing out cocktails and cigars to the backing of a booming live jazz band. Amidst it all, at center stage, stood arguably one of the most powerful men on Earth.\n\nCharles Edison flashed the crowd a smile, piping cigar in hand as an aide handed him a microphone, and for just the briefest moment it seemed the whole world stopped for him alone. The band eased down, the crowd went quiet, a single light shown down on the stage.\n\n\"Now folks, I gotta tell ya, was that not the most fantastic show on telescreen?\"\n\nA pause for the applause, naturally.\n\n\"See though, the glitz and the glam, that's not what this company is really about. It's about building a better future, today. We are, in the year of our lord nineteen thirty three, on the verge of things thought impossible a hundred years ago. We've banished want across the entire Sahara Green Belt, we've bridged the world with the telescreen, but it's important to never lose sight of the most important thing, and that's changing lives.\"\n\nEdison, letting his smile drop for a moment, glanced over the crowd. He had them on the line, and now all he needed was to reel em' in.\n\n\"I've brought on a very special guest to speak with all of you tonight, and I hope her words will affect you as much as they've affected me. She's one of the greatest success stories of the modern era, a woman dealt one of the worst hands you've ever seen, but she's perservered, and thanks to this company's advancements in hearing and sight implants, she'll be able to live a life far beyond the deal god gave her. I'd like to invite to the stage Miss Helen Keller!\"\n\nFrom the backstage emerged an aged woman, dressed simply and waving to the gathered press. Edison surrendered the stage, handing off the mic to Keller and standing back to watch his best advertisement sell augments like hotcakes. Just to be safe, though, he made sure the cameras got a good view of the ocular implants. He needed to get his money's worth out of that tech, lord knows the R&D costs alone nearly bankrupted a few departments. Could you really put a price on curing blindness, though?"
  inventorwar.1.a:0 "Especially when it'll make so much damned money?"

  inventorwar.2.t:0 "The Child of Darkness"
  inventorwar.2.d:0 "If you were to look at Teslagrad, you might think it little more than a moldering industrial park, increasingly buried in the dust of the Central Asian Uplands. The unassuming ruins, one might think, were just the leftovers of an oil refinery or perhaps a military outpost. One would be forgiven for not knowing that at one point, this was a place where wonders were born.\n\nNikola Tesla, the man who created the modern world, was pulling up cabbages. The scruffy, shuffling elderly man hardly resembled the man who had ushered in the Second Renaissance. All the virulence had seemingly been struck out of him and like a shivering automaton, he pulled up cabbages and quietly tossed them in a basket. All around him stood monoliths, vast research labs packed with equipment that had cost billions, and all of it left to dry rot in the Kazakh sun. The crumbling buildings seemed to watch him, silently judging him with cracked glass window eyes, and the wind carried the whispers of his own self hatred. There was hardly a second that went by where he had peace and his mind wasn't flooded with terrible thoughts, screams, cries. Every day he stared at the noose he'd put up in his office and every day he called himself a coward when he couldn't kick the chair.\n\nFrom a makeshift dinner table, Tesla took in a bowl of cold cabbage soup and a glass of milk. He did this same routine each afternoon, each day, for the last decade. Cabbage and milk was the only thing he could bring himself to eat anymore, anything else, anything the Tsar's men had brought him, he couldn't touch. Immaculately produced cakes and caviar, all left to rot in a fridge somewhere because all he saw in it was blood, intestines and scorched skin. He was a prisoner, just as much to his mind as to Moscow, even if now he was little more than some fetid curiosity to be discussed in the tabloids. His genius had been both his creator and his damnation, and now the Empire kept him captive in a velvet cage for fear he'd sell his secrets to the world.\n\nIn the end though, he had no secrets left to give, no new genius to impart. All he was now was an old man, surrounded by cabbages and pigeons and the hulking ruins of his mistakes."
  inventorwar.2.a:0 "And at least this way, he'd never hurt anyone again."

  inventorwar.3.t:0 "Wake Up Call"
  inventorwar.3.d:0 "The letter had sat, untouched, on his desk for nearly a week. Tesla would walk past it in the morning, regarding it with quiet dread, before proceeding with his daily breakfast of soup and milk. Soup and milk, each day every day, and every time he thought he might just work up the courage to read the letter. The pink hued paper mocked him; it was Lilya’s favorite color. It was unquestionably from her. A letter hadn’t come from his wife in nearly two years. His stomach turned over, twisting in all manner of knots and binds thinking of what it might say.\n\nEventually, a morning came where the knots became too much to bear. He snatched it from the desk and tore it open like an animal; his hands trembled, as if the handwritten note were made of tungsten. He could feel his regrets, his failures creeping along his spine. The note was simple, the pen having been pressed hard into the paper.\n\n“Mother died yesterday. Should you decide to not be the coward I know you are, the funeral will be next week.\n\nBelow is enclosed the address.\n\n- Zofia”\n\nThe note fell to the dusty floor, followed shortly by Tesla himself.\n\nThe man who built the modern century laid, curled like a child, in an empty laboratory.\n\nSuddenly, a shot of pain went through him. His breath caught in his lungs as he tried to drag himself up to the desk. His arms were lead, locked up in agony as he fumbled around like a drunk. His hand wormed its way into the desk drawer and returned with a syringe; he ripped the cover off and slammed it into his neck. Tesla crumpled back to the floor, staring out the door of his lab into the moldering remains of Teslagrad.\n\nA woman was standing outside, clad in the brightest white dress he’d ever seen. One hand held a parasol, and the other a watch. Her face was obscured by an enormous summer hat; the same kind Lilya would wear in the garden back home.\n\nHe blinked and she was gone, not even shoe prints in the dust.\n\nAn hour later Tesla slowly clambered to his feet, drenched in sweat and head pounding. One wayward glance at the letter on the floor and he knew now what he had to do. In a moment, he tossed the rest of the nitro in his jacket and went for the door. He had the energy of a man possessed now, and there was only one way to make things right.\n\nHe was headed for St. Petersburg."
  inventorwar.3.a:0 "No time to waste."

  inventorwar.4.t:0 "Siberian Sunset"
  inventorwar.4.d:0 "Russia had changed, that much was evident from the train ride. He could have taken a luxury car, he had the rubles to afford one, but Tesla couldn’t enjoy that kind of pampering anymore.\n\nOf course, an Okhrana agent was on the train with him. He’d gotten used to the tails years ago. At least now they were getting paid to do something besides watch a depressive shut-in repeat the same routine for years.\n\nSlowly, the Kazakh countryside gave way to Siberian farmland. Old family farms interspersed with vast company agrocomplexes that stretched off for kilometers; the stench of modified cattle wafted through the cabin. Steel grain towers, as high as metropole buildings, loomed like obelisks. A few were emblazoned with a familiar name: “TESLA ELECTRICWORKS”.\n\nTesla shuddered and tried to relax in his seat; sleep didn’t come easy anymore. After an hour, he finally drifted off and the train was replaced with an extravagant sitting room. The fuzzy memory of a decade ago enveloped him. It was a quiet evening or, rather, as quiet an evening as one could get at the Winter Palace. Protestors shifted about outside the gates, shouting slogans and waving signs, their faces indistinct against the city.\n\nThe Tsar stood by the window and scoffed, turning to Tesla and shaking his head.\n\n“These people,” he said. “They think they know how to rule themselves, but look at how much chaos they’ve caused?”\n\nTesla didn’t respond, merely sitting with his head cupped in one hand and a newspaper in the other. It was the bulletin from Minsk; over a hundred dead. Russian Shock Troopers opening up on a crowd of protestors. Teslaworks weapons, of course, he could tell the make and model just from the blurry photographs. Alexander kept on, animated in his movements and frustrations.\n\n“But no, these Poles, these little Russians, these balts; they reject what we’ve built for them. They’d rather burn it all down than-“\n\n“Your majesty,” Tesla croaked, setting the paper on a nearby table. “I feel I have blood on my hands.”\n\nAlexander paused, glancing over the inventor as if taking stock. He scoffed, reached into his breast pocket and tossed Tesla a handkerchief.\n\n“Would you like to wipe them?”\n\nThe mocking tone of the Tsar echoed in his mind as he awoke."
  inventorwar.4.a:0 "No more sleep until the capital, then."

  inventorwar.5.t:0 "A Death in the Family"
  inventorwar.5.d:0 "Zofia’s mother was dead.\n\nShe’d known it was coming, prepared for it, steeled herself, thinking maybe it would soften the blow. It didn’t. She sat by the bedside, face buried in her hands and practically screamed in grief. Zofia reached out and snatched up her mother’s hand and clung to it like a life preserver. If she just held on long enough, maybe the warmth would come back, maybe her mother would rise and hold her, even just one more time.\n\nIt never happened.\n\nThe body remained inert; warmth slowly draining. Lilya’s jaw hung slightly ajar, her eyes glassy, like a wax simulacrum of an elderly woman. The blood settled and the warmth fled, and Zofia was left clutching a hand that now felt alien to her. This was no longer Lilya; it was merely an object that could once have been called her mother. From behind, a small hand tugged at Zofia’s coat.\n\n“Is grandma alright?”\n\nHer guts were heavy, twisting and folding on one another. With a single shaking hand, she pulled her son in close. A moment passed and the two were interrupted by a doctor.\n\n“Miss Tesla, if it’s alright I have a few papers I need you to sign.”\n\nZofia wiped her eyes and rose from the chair, taking the pen and paper and scribbling away at whatever legal nonsense the clinic needed to report a death. Midway through, she paused and glanced at the young man.\n\n“You wouldn’t happen to have an extra envelope, would you?”\n\n“Of course,” the doctor nodded. “Was there someone you’d like us to notify?”\n\nThe grief gave way to hate, and she practically spit in rage as she spoke."
  inventorwar.5.a:0 "“My father.”"

  inventorwar.6.t:0 "Arrival"
  inventorwar.6.d:0 "St. Petersburg was different than he remembered. The city just kept going and going, an endless labyrinth of industrial quarters and template apartment blocks whose dominance was only challenged by the Neva. The old city was mercifully untouched for the most part; the Russians had not embraced the British and American tendencies to entomb their own metropole.\n\nThe Mariinsky shadowed him as he stepped out of the station, cold wind blowing in off the Baltic sea. There was an immense noise to every aspect of the city now; Tesla had grown far too accustomed to the oppressive silence of the steppe. Everywhere he looked he could see throngs of people, moving so quickly as to become a blur of faces, indistinguishable from one another save the occasional odd detail.\n\nHe glanced at the address, steeled himself, and began to walk.\n\nTesla traced the steps from the station, trying to string together some kind of plan. The funeral would not be for a few days; he hoped that perhaps he could track Zofia down before then. He slouched down on a bench by the roadside, mulling over ideas. He didn’t know if she was still using his last name, he didn’t know where she worked, he could only assume she still lived in the city based on the address.\n\nHe caught a glimpse of movement from the corner of his eye.\n\nAcross the street, a man sat down on a bench and unfolded a newspaper. He looked uncomfortable, shabbily clothed but not as though he were a vagrant. He looked like a rich man’s approximation of how a vagrant might dress. The man shuffled the newspaper uneasily, stealing glances at Tesla and pretending to read while he took notes.\n\nAn Okhrana agent. They were still tailing him. He almost burst into laughter.Who better to ask then the agency that had been watching him for so long? He rose to his feet and started his way towards the man."
  inventorwar.6.a:0 "If anyone would know, they would."

  inventorwar.7.t:0 "Reunion"
  inventorwar.7.d:0 "“You’re certain this is the right place?”\n\nThe agent nodded; hands buried in his coat pockets. The tenement was a monolith of steel and concrete that stretched into the sky. A decade ago, Tesla would have thought it a marvel. Today, it was just one of a hundred, perhaps a thousand skyscrapers that loomed over the skyline. A canopy of wires hung overhead, scattering the setting sun into millions of shards of light. A skytrain rumbled overhead on the concrete bridge between the buildings.\n\nTesla tried the front door, but it was locked. An panel of lights and buttons to his right read off units; a few lights flickered. He resisted the urge to replace the bulbs and motioned for the Okhrana agent. The man sighed, dug around in his coat pocket and withdrew a notepad and an odd-looking key. He first scribbled on the notepad and tore it off the backing, shoving the crumpled paper in Tesla’s hands. The inventor let it unfurl in his hand, revealing a hastily written unit number as the agent shoved the key into a slot on the bottom of the panel. A quiet beep resounded, and the door unlocked. Tesla let a slight smile creep across his face and extended his hand to the agent.\n\n“I appreciate this, truly, Agent-“\n\nThe man cut him off, waving off the handshake. Tesla’s smiled faded.\n\n“Yezhov”, he said before turning to leave, pausing to get one last jab in.\n\n“And remember, Mr. Tesla, we’re watching. You already disappeared once, best not to let it happen again, no?”\n\nAnd with that, the agent vanished into the crowd, leaving Tesla the arduous task of finding the unit on his own.\n\nAn hour went by before Tesla finally found the unit. Unit 451, on the fourteenth floor. He stood in front of the metal door for what felt like an eternity; the body was meat; he couldn’t bring himself to knock. The days of travel, the bluster, all of it died the instant he stood before that simple metal door. Could he bring himself to do it? What would she say? Would she say anything? Was it already too late?\n\nThe hypotheticals became irrelevant one-by-one as his arm raised, shaking, and a hand rapped on the door. It felt like a knock on the door of god. The reverberation hung in the air for a few seconds, giving the man just enough time to regret the decision before he heard a lock unlatch.\n\nHis daughter stood in the doorway, at first looking sullen, then terribly angry."
  inventorwar.7.a:0 "As if her body were not her own, Zofia stepped through the doorway, wound up her arm and proceeded to sucker punch her father in the face."

  inventorwar.8.t:0 "Father and Daughter"
  inventorwar.8.d:0 "The two Teslas sat in the dining room, the elder holding a steak to his blackened eye. Across the table, his daughter stared him down, her coffee going cold. An airship shuffled past the window outside, “TESLA ELECTRICWORKS” scrawled along the side in stark black paint. Anywhere he looked, he could spy his name stamped proudly on appliances and cars and zeppelins. A sensation creeped up his back, half shame and half pride, disgust at the company that bore his name and delight to see it so pervasive. His daughter’s voice cut off the rumination.\n\n“Why are you here?”\n\nHe cocked his head. Zofia rolled her eyes.\n\n“I didn’t think you’d actually show up” she said, dim eyes glancing to the coffee cup. “She asked for you before she died, you know, even near the end. I had to tell her you were on business.”\n\nNikola set the steak down and let out a deep sigh. For what felt like an eternity he tried to find the words. A million theories and simulacrums, and he couldn’t think of what else to say to his daughter.\n\n“I’m sorry,” he croaked. “After what happened, I couldn’t bear being here. I-“\n\nZofia ran her hands over her face, her rage barely disguised as Tesla fumbled through an apology ten years too late. She brought a hand up to stop him.\n\n“Whatever this is, whatever you thought you’d accomplish-“\n\nHer father cut her off; a hand clenched.\n\n“I don’t think I have much time, Zofia, and I don’t have anywhere else to stay.”\n\nHe leaned forward, trying to come up with the words. Years of isolation had not helped his lackluster social skills.\n\n“Just- please. Give me a chance to make things right.”\n\nZofia sighed, rose from the table and poured her cold coffee down the drain. In the other room, Victor slept, still out of classes on bereavement. As much as she hated him, did he still deserve a chance to see his grandson? She didn’t know, but looking back at her father, she found it hard to truly hate him. He was a husk, not the monster she’d painted for so many years, just another absentee father."
  inventorwar.8.a:0 "“You can stay here until the funeral, but after that I want you gone.”"

  inventorwar.9.t:0 "Grandfather and Son"
  inventorwar.9.d:0 "Daylight rose over Saint Petersburg, flowing down the streets between the skyscrapers. Nikola watched it from the balcony, his breath hovering in the air ahead like smoke. Overhead, an airship passed, horn blaring. Yet again, his name was emblazoned on the side. Anywhere he looked, he saw his name plastered. Tesla light fixtures, Tesla airships, Tesla train cars, Tesla coffee makers, his last name repeated ad nauseum until it no longer felt like a name but some kind of mantra. Few men could comprehend living in history, but for Nikola, his name, his legacy was interwoven into the very wire that powered this country.\n\nZofia rapped her hand on the door of the balcony and his daydreams vanished. She was dressed formally, carrying a briefcase and a thermos.\n\n“I have to head into work early, can I trust you to keep an eye on Viktor for a few hours?”\n\nHis brow furrowed; she rolled her eyes.\n\n“If you’re going to stay here, the least you could do is spend some time with your grandson.”\n\nStepping back inside, Tesla loomed over the child in the living room. The space was already cramped, but between the three, it felt unimaginably small. The child sat in front of a Kinegram box, gormlessly watching some kind of cartoon, headphones strapped to where they smushed his unkempt hair. Zofia scoffed, shaking her head as the cartoons faded into an advertisement for some kind of “action doll”; A handful of them sat nearby in various states of disrepair.\n\n“Viktor,” she said, peeling the headset off. The child groaned quietly, grasping fruitlessly while Zofia gently turned his head.\n\n“Why don’t you spend some time with your grandfather?”\n\nViktor looked Nikola over, cheerful face now inscrutable. It was as if the child had taken stock, and he had found the man before him wanting. Nikola fumbled to the ground, legs popping as he sat. The two continued to sit, Zofia finally breaking the stalemate and heading for the door. As it latched shut behind her, Tesla grasped one of the dolls and looked it over. A soldier, Russian most likely, in some kind of armored knight suit.\n\n“So, uh-“ he croaked. “You like, em, dolls?”\n\nThe child sneered, crossing his arms in protest."
  inventorwar.9.a:0 "“They’re ACTION figures, not dolls.”"

  inventorwar.10.t:0 "Commonality"
  inventorwar.10.d:0 "“Now, I want you to think about an animal. Any animal.”\n\nThe man nodded, taking a deep breath. The electrodes on his head glinted in the dim light of the laboratory. After a moment, the printer nearby whirred to life, spitting out a punched card. The image of a cat was stamped into the card, crude but unmistakable. Zofia smiled, showing the card to the gathered researchers.\n\n“And what animal did you think of?”\n\n“A cat, Ma’am.”\n\nA round of applause erupted; Zofia gave a small bow. A motion of the hand and a nearby projector clicked on, tape spooled up, and an image blazed up on the screen. A diagram of two men, and a tower between them. The researchers watched intently as she motioned to the screen.\n\n“As you have seen, the Consensus was able to detect the subject’s thoughts and transfer them on to a printed sheet. With the right direction, we can therefore acquire concrete subconscious data from a prompted subject.”\n\nThe projector clicked another slide into place; a group of people surrounding a tower.\n\n“The Tesla towers throughout the nation can be retrofitted with these receivers, allowing us to acquire data on the thoughts of the nation, all with a simple implant.”\n\nAnother click, another slide, this time a set of towers across Russia.\n\n“This is where the Commonality Consensus comes in. Imagine a nation unbound by the need for elected officials, instead guided by the shared mental consensus of millions. Instead of lawmakers debating endless hours, a simple ping to the network and a million minds can supply their vote with a thought.”\n\nZofia flicked the projector off and stepped in front of the screen. With a smile, she held up the mass of electrodes and wires."
  inventorwar.10.a:0 "“Gentlemen, what I propose to you is simple: Democracy, Perfected.”"

  inventorwar.11.t:0 "Lysenko v. Tesla"
  inventorwar.11.d:0 "As the crowd filed out, Zofia sighed and set the electrode cap aside. They’d planned on demonstrating next week, but with the Board of Directors in town early, she needed to seize the chance. The applause was a good sign, but what she needed was capital, more test subjects, a greater benefactor than her personal bank account. There was the company stipend, but she refused to touch it. Taking a handout from her absentee father’s company was a line she was, at least for now, unwilling to cross.\n\nThe unspoken presence of another drew her attention away from her thoughts. A man sat across from her in the lab, just barely out of sight. Her eyes fell on him and he rose, stepping out into the scant sunlight that shone through the windows above. A beady little man in a suit with a terrible combover.\n\n“Tesla,” he said, making only the slightest effort to disguise his distaste. Zofia’s nails dug into her desk.\n\n“What forced you out of your hole this time, Lysenko?”\n\nHe chuckled quietly.\n\n“I just wanted to see what all the buzz was about,” he strolled over to the desk, lifting the electrode cap and turning it over in his hands. Zofia watched him closely with a mix of disgust and fear. A part of her wanted to slap him, snatch it from his hands and drive him out of her lab. Another, more rational part knew she couldn’t, even with her last name she couldn’t get away with antagonizing Russia’s favorite freakshow director. Lysenko set the cap down and gave her a smile that could have eaten all the shit on Earth.\n\n“-and I’m not terribly impressed.”\n\nTesla leaned back, the creak of the office chair echoing through the lab like a gunshot. Lysenko’s beady eyes remained locked on hers, that stupid smile still scrawled across his face.\n\n“Well, when I get into the business of disfiguring animals, I’ll be sure to give you a call.”\n\nThe smile faded, Lysenko leaned forward, both hands on the desk.\n\n“You got funding for your little brain project because of your name, girl, but the Kremlin won’t fund these fantasy projects of yours.”\n\n“No, they fund your little fantasy projects,” she spat back, rising from the desk.\n\n“You might be able to impress the Tsar with your monster parlor tricks, sticking lungs and hearts into people, but what I can offer them is real, tangible changes.”\n\n“I make them better humans. What you’re offering them”, Lysenko sneered, “is to build a machine to make themselves redundant.”\n\nHe leaned back off the desk, headed for the door.\n\n“You want to make a machine to replace the government, and what after that Perhaps a machine to replace all of us? Subsume flesh to steel?”"
  inventorwar.11.a:0 "“Perhaps just a machine to replace you, Doctor.”"

  inventorwar.12.t:0 "Viktor"
  inventorwar.12.d:0 "An island of green in a sea of metal, the arboretum was encased in a thin plastic shell, adorned with fanned ventilators. The smog of the city flowed around it, held back by clogged filters. Nikola watched from a cheap metal bench as pigeons moved across the plasticine roof. He remembered when finding a park in Petersburg was as simple as walking down the street; now, he had to cross the complex and ride an elevator just to find this little slice of life.\n\nThe boy sat next to him, kicking his feet impatiently at the grass. Tesla, however, found himself increasingly lost in thought. When he first moved to Russia, the immensity of nature was manifest wherever he looked. Vast forests of aspens and pines stretched as far as the horizon in some places. He glanced down at a bed of flowers, planted upon hydroponic beds and organized neatly by type. In the forest, wildflowers grew and intermingled into a menagerie of color. Here, there could be no such disorganization. Man had planted his flag over nature and found its’ disharmony unacceptable.\n\n“Can we go now?”\n\nViktor’s voice broke the silence, snapping Tesla from his thoughts. He looked down at him, befuddled.\n\n“Go? We just got here.”\n\n“I can see trees on the screen whenever I want.”\n\nTesla cocked his head; a flock of pigeons scattered overhead as a passenger zeppelin blazed past. \n\n“Have you ever been out of the city?”\n\n“Sometimes we go to other cities.”\n\nThe old man sighed, looking away from the boy and back to the miniature forest that surrounded them. How long would a place like this last before it would be torn down to build more apartments? How long before there were no more places like this here, no more places like this anywhere? How long before a generation was raised entirely beneath a steel sky, concrete trees, rust and dust?\n\nOnce more, Viktor pulled him from his thoughts. The boy rose to his feet and tugged on Tesla’s jacket, motioning back towards the airlock.\n\n“We’re gonna miss my shows.”\n\nTesla rose from the bench, taking one more glance of the arboretum, then back at Viktor before they departed."
  inventorwar.12.a:0 "The kids aren’t alright."

  inventorwar.13.t:0 "Bad Dreams"
  inventorwar.13.d:0 "The streetlights of Budapest pierced through the windows of Tesla’s laboratory. Yet, when he looked out, the city was silent and dark. The ubiquitous streetlamps were swallowed in an ocean of black. Figures moved below, occasionally glancing up at him with faces he couldn’t make out. From behind, a familiar voice rose, young and filled with the vigor of a man without mistakes.\n\n“You failed them,” the voice said. Each syllable dripped with venom; words more snarled rather than spoken. “Three billion people, trillions of years, all to culminate in you, and you failed them.”\n\nA younger Tesla stood before him, indistinct. The Older Tesla found his eyes became fuzzy when he tried to look at the Younger, as though the memory rejected perception. It stepped forward, footsteps silent against the hardwood as it spoke.\n\n“The power to change the world and you deferred it, handed it off to kings and emperors, moneychangers, monsters.”\n\nThey were standing in a trench now, the stench of death and human waste conquering the senses like an invading army. He could feel vomit rising. The younger motioned around; mountains of corpses laid about, the sounds of battle somehow both deafening and distant. Somewhere, a man screamed for his mother while a bullet settled in his torn open belly.\n\n“This is your legacy, our legacy,” the Younger Tesla said. “In how many homes would an empty armchair be occupied, how many graves would be empty, if you had just stopped?”\n\nThe Younger Tesla pointed a blurred finger, face swirling and distorting into a maelstrom of features that defied description.\n\n“This is the world you crafted, the world we made, when we handed the Steele of Daedalus to a tinpot Tsar.”\n\nIt was impossible to tell, but he almost sensed a wicked smile in the swirling din of his younger self’s face.\n\n“And Zofia will make the same mistake you did.”\n\nTesla rose with a cry, the couch and sheets soaked in sweat. His throbbing head fell into his hands while the sound of the radiator kicking on masked his sobbing."
  inventorwar.13.a:0 ". . ."

  inventorwar.14.t:0 "New Morning, New Century"
  inventorwar.14.d:0 "An unwelcome morning came, light breaching in shafts through the slats in the apartment window. Tesla lurched out of bed in a daze; he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. Messy hair, eyes reddened and baggy, he looked half dead. The door behind him creaked as he stepped into the living room; Viktor and Zofia were already crowded around the kinescreen. Viktor, clearly bored, regarded the inventor with a disinterested stare. Zofia, on the other hand, rose to her feet as he entered.\n\n“The Tsar has been shot.”\n\nThe sentence took time to worm its’ way through the aging Tesla’s neurons. The Tsar? Alexander? No, no, it was Michael now wasn’t it? His befuddled expression was broken by the distant call of police sirens. Somewhere, not too close but not too far away, an explosion rang out. Zofia ran to the window, flicking the automated shutter switch. They hummed into place, shrouding the room in darkness as the three returned their attention to the kinescreen. The news broadcast had been replaced with an emergency tone. A white Russian eagle dominated the screen as a monotone voice read out instructions; it was difficult to tell if the voice was simulated or human.\n\n“Remain indoors, a curfew of 1800 hours is now in effect for Saint Petersburg. Groups of individuals greater than three are not to congregate outdoors until an all clear has been issued. An official statement from the acting Prime Minister will be issued shortly.”\n\nOutside, the sounds of piston-powered mechanica filled the air. A great din of truck exhaust and tank treads on pavement followed. A military industrial orchestra filled the streets of the capital in what seemed like a matter of moments."
  inventorwar.14.a:0 "Somewhere out in the distance, the unmistakable clatter of gunfire rang out."

  inventorwar.15.t:0 "Balcony"
  inventorwar.15.d:0 "Days went by, then weeks, and with time the atmosphere of Saint Petersburg began to normalize. The military remained present, however, and the sounds of troops patrolling the streets at night had become unremarkable. Mind you, to Tesla everything beyond the walls of his self-imposed exile was remarkable. Sleep was still uneasy, he flopped in bed, thrashing and sweating until forced to awaken at some ungodly hour. Tonight was no different; Tesla emerged from his room to find Zofia on the balcony, a lit cigarette in hand.\n\n“Trouble sleeping?”\n\nShe shot him an ugly expression, barely masking hatred. Tesla had long since grown tired of the theatrics, but she had offered him a place to stay when he’d done everything to draw her ire. Tesla joined her at the balcony, leaning on the cold metal rail. The sounds of the night enveloped the two, the smell of exhaust from the factory district, the heavy thumping of rail cars above.\n\nZofia finally cut the silence.\n\n“I wondered if I’d see you again. Spent years thinking about what I’d say.”\n\nShe took a long drag, then blew, letting the smoke curl in the air.\n\n“Now that you’re here all I can think to ask is why? You had everything, you were the pillar of empires, the most important man in the world, and you ran away from all of it like a coward.”\n\nHer slender fingers curled into a fist.\n\n“Did you know the board pushed us out? The only thing they still give me is a pension, and I refused to take it, not after what you did to us.”\n\nTesla cupped his head in his hands, fingers ran through thinning hair."
  inventorwar.15.a:0 "He couldn’t say anything, the words refused to come out."
  inventorwar.15.b:0 "“The truth is that I saw what was coming, and I couldn’t bear to be a party to it.”"

  inventorwar.16.t:0 "Deafening Silence"
  inventorwar.16.d:0 "“Figures,” Zofia said, snubbing the cigarette against the rail. She began to walk inside, pausing just before closing the balcony door.\n\n“I’m glad mother didn’t see you like this. If this is what’s left of the great Nikola Tesla, then maybe it’s better the name dies with us.”\n\nThe door slammed shut, leaving Tesla to his thoughts. Above, an airship passed, horn blaring. A swarm of drones orbited around it, red blinking lights that flickered and flew through the night sky. Along the side of the airship were the words:\n\nTESLA ELECTRICWORKS"
  inventorwar.16.a:0 "Even the universe itself felt the need to kick him while he was down."

  inventorwar.17.t:0 "Explanations"
  inventorwar.17.d:0 "“Be a party to it?”\n\nZofia gave him a strange look, another Teslaworks Airship blared overhead as if the universe itself felt the need to answer. Tesla sighed, then continued.\n\n“When I first began my work, I wished to elevate people, elevate humanity. For years that’s what I thought I was doing. When I made weapons, I made them with the belief they’d deter wars. When the weapons I’d designed were turned on human beings, I was too deep in that river to turn back.”\n\nHollow eyes looked out across the Saint Petersburg skyline. The tower living complexes, the vast industrial district, the twinkling lights of the financial zone. The airships buzzed overhead, and to the West the Baltic lapped at the corrugated steel coast. All of this, down to the most minute detail, owed him for its existence in some small detail. To Tesla, all that credit wasn’t just meaningless, it was a curse. He carried on, letting the cool sprawl air wash over him.\n\n“I don’t expect you to forgive me for running. I felt like I had to leave everything behind, put myself somewhere I could never hurt anyone again. The life I’d built with you, your mother, it was a sham. All of it built on the charred bodies of the people who I’d helped kill.”\n\nHe turned to his daughter; she watched him pensively, indecision painted on her features. Zofia looked down, briefly deep in thought.\n\n“I can’t forgive you”, she said, “I spent so many years hating you and-“\n\nHer breath caught, she took another drag, tears welling in her eyes.\n\n\“We needed you, and you just left us. It might have been a sham to you, but it wasn’t to me.”\n\nShe snubbed the cigarette against the railing, silence hanging in the air with the smoke."
  inventorwar.17.a:0 "The two Teslas stood on the balcony for a time, then without speaking returned to bed."

  inventorwar.18.t:0 "Memento Mori"
  inventorwar.18.d:0 "The funeral was an unremarkable affair, only a dozen or so attendees. Zofia picked out a small plot outside the sprawl, in one of the few remaining untouched plots of greenery. Tesla felt, as always, like a spectator. Despite being married, he felt like he barely knew his late wife anymore.\n\nSo much time had passed, too many years in isolation, so many things unsaid. Regrets were his only real company now, aside from his daughter, and she couldn’t bear to look at him while Lilya was interred.\n\nTesla thought back to the night they met, a Winter ball in Riga. He felt like a complete outsider at a party that was essentially for him. The electrification of Moscow had been a rousing success, and so the Tsar had called for celebration. The Baltics were next up, and of course Riga would be a new model city. They’d met outside, he’d needed a chance to breathe, to get a break from shaking hands and supposedly grateful smiles.\n\nNow, none of that really mattered."
  inventorwar.18.a:0 "Lilya was gone, that old life had long since slipped through his fingers."

  inventorwar.19.t:0 "Workshopping"
  inventorwar.19.d:0 "“What is this?”\n\nZofia looked up from her desk, Tesla was glancing over a series of diagrams. Zofia’s bedroom was a slow motion disaster, a desk and workbench crammed in alongside a simple cot. Papers and buckets of electronic parts were scattered about.\n\n“A project,” she said, setting her pen down.\n\n“Might I ask what?”\n\n“I call it the Commonality. It’s a brain interface network, pulls information from the mind and formats it as useable data.”\n\nTesla picked up the prototype, adjusting the straps and diodes. Zofia sighed, unamused.\n\n“Was there something you needed?\n\n”Tesla was still wrapped up in looking at the device, her comment broke him out of his fascination.\n\n“Would you like help? I know you wanted me gone but perhaps I could make myself useful?”\n\nThe old man smiled, earnestly, for the first time in years. Zofia raised an eyebrow, glancing back over the endless paperwork and machinery. With another sigh, she shifted her chair over and motioned for her father to take a seat. Tesla eagerly sat; he was just happy to be back in a workshop again. Zofia’s was not unlike his own back in Budapest, decades prior, but without the baggage of the past. He felt a new vigor, as if he were back in those halcyon days of unrestrained invention.\n\n“So,” he said, picking up a pen."
  inventorwar.19.a:0 "“How can I help?""

  inventorwar.20.t:0 "Outside Interests"
  inventorwar.20.d:0 "Standing in the university lab, Tesla felt a sense of dread and awe. His daughter’s work was laid bare throughout the room, messily organized in ways only she could comprehend. Zofia had, begrudgingly, allowed her father to see her proper laboratory. It wasn’t that dissimilar to Teslagrad, the only thing missing was the arid desert air and the smell of cabbage. He leaned over a small glass container; a pair of mice ran back and forth within, taking breaks to sip water or eat. They hardly seemed to notice the tiny blinking diodes protruding from their heads. One of the diodes blinked three times, prompting a teletype machine nearby to begin spitting out paper. A lengthy report slowly took form, regions of the brain highlighted and notated with descriptions of activity.\n\nThe door to the lab opened, the report slipping from Tesla’s hands to the floor. A stocky man in a heavy coat stepped inside, peeling a facemask away to reveal a freshly shaved, angular face. An odd pin was attached to the jacket, an owl contained in an atom. Zofia regarded the man, he responded in kind and reached into his jacket to withdraw a small metallic box. She took it under her arm, sauntering over to the desk while the man secured his face mask. Tesla cocked his head, the messenger noting his curiosity with a simple shrug.\n\n“Smog in the air, can’t be too careful these days.”\n\nAnd with that the messenger vanished out the door.\n\nZofia slid the box over the counter, pressing a button on the side with a satisfying click. An indentation became visible with an almost imperceptible needle. She took a deep breath, then pressed her thumb down on the needle. A second later she pulled it away as the metal box let out a subdued “beep” and opened fully.\n\nStepping towards the desk, Tesla glanced down at the documents within. The same symbol, the same owl stamped over and over on pages and pages of research. One name stood out, and after a moment he finally screwed up the courage to ask."
  inventorwar.20.a:0 "“What’s Area Zero?”"

  inventorwar.21.t:0 "Blacksite"
  inventorwar.21.d:0 "Zofia sat down, reading through the documents while she spoke.\n\n“It’s a research site in the Far East. They offered me a job a few years back. I couldn’t leave Viktor alone.“ \n\nShe glanced up at her father, there was a real venom to her tone for a moment. She looked back down at the papers.\n\n“They’ve been testing my theories, seeing if the commonality works.”\n\n“And?”\n\n“They’re interested. Their director is dispatching a team.”\n\nTesla felt a chill crawling up his spine, breath tightening in his lungs like a vice. He ran a hand through his frazzled hair; for a moment he was sitting in the Winter Palace again, looking up at an indignant Tsar.\n\n“Y-You can’t.”\n\nHer eyes narrowed; the paper dropped to the desk.\n\n“What?”\n\nHe let himself fall into the chair opposing her, hands shaking.\n\n“Zofia, you cannot work with these people. They’ll say whatever they have to, but they only want your work because they think they can use it.”\n\nA hand lurched out, snatching up one of the neural diode caps on the desk, Tesla rose, gesturing wildly as he spoke.\n\n“They’ll take this, they’ll take it and they’ll turn it into a weapon. They’ll tell you you’re making the world better, and in the same breath they’ll turn it on people. You’ll be there, you’ll have blood onyour hands, blood so thick you can never wash it away, blood-“\n\nZofia raised her hand, snatching the diode cap out of her father’s grip.\n\n“You think you can lecture me?”\n\nShe wagged a finger in his face.\n\n“You knew exactly what you were doing. You built a gun and then bemoaned the world for using it. You buried yourself in a desert, left all of us behind so you could wallow away until you killed yourself or dropped dead. You want to lecture me on morality?”"
  inventorwar.21.a:0 "“I think it’s time for you to leave, father.”"
  
  inventorwar.22.t:0 "From Below"
  inventorwar.22.d:0 "The tower that bore her family’s name rose over Saint Petersburg like a monolith. Light beacons and wires dotted its’ surface while machining crews dangled from suspended platforms. Zofia glanced over the plans with the Area Zero scientists, marking points where the transmitters would be fitted. It was a fairly simple idea, retrofitting the Tesla towers to work as relays. Simple, of course, for the ones on the ground. She didn’t envy the men clambering the scaffolding to implement her plans.\n\nDown below, Nikola Tesla walked the streets of the city, glancing occasionally up at the skyline above. Hot, smoggy air carried down from the factory complex towers, mingling with the cool air that blew in from the Baltic Sea. Deep in thought, his steps carried him past the Industrial district and back to the Housing Archoplexes. Vast complexes of Brutalist housing, dotted with a million lights, not unlike the stars above that were invisible beyond the smoke choked sky.\n\nHe couldn’t go back to Teslagrad, and he couldn’t go back to Zofia. Once again, he was alone, left with nothing more than the clothes on his back and regrets in his mind.\n\nExhausted, Tesla flopped down on a bench overlooking an enclosed arboretum. Through tempered glass, birch and pine trees grew in neatly designated spots with little placards and fencing.\n\nIt was only in noticing the oddity of the scene that it occurred to Tesla; he hadn’t seen a natural tree in the entire city outside an enclosed space."
  inventorwar.22.a:0 "With that thought, he laid his head on the park bench and let sleep take him."

  inventorwar.23.t:0 "Journal"
  inventorwar.23.d:0 "The flat felt cold, even emptier than it had before her father had returned. Zofia sat at the dining room table, running her thumb along a cup of synthetic coffee. Even with sugar, the stuff was horridly bitter. Even with her salary, she couldn’t afford the real thing. Just before bringing it to her lips, her eyes fell on a pack near the door. It was unassuming, military-issue perhaps, but it wasn’t hers.\n\nIt was her father’s satchel. He must have forgotten it after their fight.\n\nWith some trepidation, she stepped over and swung open the flap on the top, finding some odds and ends. A tin of cabbage, a tin of milk, a stuffed pigeon, and a leather-bound journal. The latter caught her attention especially, and she retrieved it.\n\nLaying it out across the table, Zofia thumbed through the pages. Her father’s thoughts, sketches, blueprints, laid out through the decades. A few entries about the Tsar, about Teslagrad, about the company and the war. Nearest the middle, something slipped out and clattered on to the table.\n\nA photo, faded and yellowed, of her mother and father on their wedding day.\n\nShe sighed, turning her attention back to the journal. There was a section that had been folded over and tucked into the lining. With a slight tug, she pulled it loose and unfurled a ripped set of notes. They were scatterbrained, as if written in the midst of a panic attack, scratched or perhaps more accurately carved into the paper with the frantic scrawl of the deranged.\n\nOne paper drew her attention, sketches of scenes and icons she couldn’t quite understand. A cog and torch flag flying over Big Ben, a cloud shaped like a mushroom enveloping a city, a hammer and sickle behind what looked like a bearded elderly man in glasses. Amongst all of it, scrawling of the word “ruin” over and over again. On one page, a photo was taped, showing a man in an odd looking uniform standing in front of a crowd. He was flanked by strange red flags and torches and an army of soldiers in black uniforms. What was truly odd, though, was a writing penciled on to the photograph.\n\n“January 11th, 1962.”"
  inventorwar.23.a:0 "“How can a photo be from the future?”"

  inventorwar.24.t:0 "Questions"
  inventorwar.24.d:0 "Predictably, the knock at the door came sometime around noon, just as Zofia was finishing making lunch. Her father stood in the doorway once more, lightly dusted in snow and shivering.\n\n“I’m sorry,” he mumbled. “I forgot my things, I won’t be but a moment.”\n\nZofia sighed, gesturing for him to come in as she returned to the kitchen. A pot of stew on the counter boiled under her watch as she called out to the dining room.\n\n“I have to apologize myself, actually. I took a look through your things while you were out.”\n\nSilence.\n\n“I wasn’t sure if you’d come back,” she continued.\n\nTesla stepped into the kitchen, satchel over his shoulder and journal in his hand. He leafed through the leatherbound book before glancing back at his daughter, suddenly very pale.\n\n“You read- You saw all of that, didn’t you?”\n\n“Yes, I was curious actually, what were all those sketches?”\n\nHe closed the journal, stuffing it back into his bag. He was even paler, a thin sheen of sweat beginning to manifest on his brow. He felt suddenly lightheaded, tripping over his words.\n\n“J-Just some old traveling notes. N-Nothing to-“\n\nPain. His chest erupted in pain. In an instant he collapsed to the floor, gasping for air. Zofia rushed over, panic and confusion on her face as her father convulsed. Viktor emerged from his room, glancing aside to see his mother trying desperately to revive his grandfather. Stock-still, he could only watch in terror as Zofia rushed off to call for a doctor."
  inventorwar.24.a:0 ". . ."

  inventorwar.25.t:0 "Hospital"
  inventorwar.25.d:0 "By the time they got to the hospital, Nikola Tesla was near dead. He laid in bed, hooked up to all manner of machines and pumps, scarcely cognizant of where he even was. It was a scene Zofia was uncomfortably familiar with. He laid there, staring at nothing in particular while medications flowed through his veins.\n\nThe doctors told her it was a massive heart attack; frankly he was lucky to be alive at all, but the prognosis was poor at best. Even if they had an available transplant, the aging man was hardly an ideal candidate. Thus, the architect of the world found himself at long last making acquaintance with the reaper.\n\nZofia sat, Viktor in lap, and stared out the window. From afar, she could see the Tesla tower being completed in the distance. They were close to activation, but naturally she had stepped away from the project momentarily."
  inventorwar.25.a:0 "All she could do now was wait and watch her father die."

  inventorwar.26.t:0 "Adjustments"
  inventorwar.26.d:0 "“Naturally, some modifications had to be made to the system. Orders from above, you understand.”\n\nZofia glanced over the new specifications. The implants had been modified, but in a way that wasn’t entirely clear. It was all buried under mountains and mountains of verbiage. Deliberate obfuscation, that much was clear. She sighed in annoyance, looking up at the Security Officer.\n\n“I understand, but we can’t improvise implants for millions of people. Next time your superiors make changes, I need to be made aware.”\n\n“Of course, of course.”The officer walked off, leaving Zofia to try and piece together exactly what had been changed. She didn’t trust the new project managers, and she trusted the new government even less. Their patronage had been more than forthcoming, but it was clear they had something they wanted to get out of this beyond just altruism.\n\nShe never noticed the slight adjustment to the neurological matrix, almost imperceptible even to its’ designer. Just enough adjustment to allow a counter-frequency to be transmitted and received by the brain.\n\n Just enough to make a nudge to the psyche, barely even noticeable to the user."
  inventorwar.26.a:0 "A counter-frequency, controlled by the same government patrons who had made the design change."

  inventorwar.27.t:0 "Taking Stock"
  inventorwar.27.d:0 "A few days passed before her father could speak again, though it was seemingly only rasps and croaks. His senses had somewhat returned, but only enough to glance at her occasionally. For the first time, perhaps in her whole life, she felt pity for her father. She’d built him up for so long as the villain, the great architect of her sorrow, but now, at the end of the road all she saw was a man. Not a monolith, not a monster, but a fragile old man dying in a hospital bed.\n\n“I’m- I’m sorry”, he croaked out. Zofia perked up, leaning in close.\n\n“For what?”\n\n“For everything, I should have been there for the two of you. I wasn’t.”\n\nHe reached out, grasping her wrist.\n\n“Everything I did, I did for you, for your mother. For the world. I just wanted to make things better.”[get_reconciliation_text_1]"

  inventorwar.28.t:0 "The Lever of History"
  inventorwar.28.d:0 "Zofia was never good with the press. Mind you, she’d avoided them most of her life, but even then being the daughter of Nikola Tesla meant a certain level of journalistic interest, however minor. The crowd assembled around the Tesla Tower compound, implants blinking behind their ears, ready to see the future of the Russian Empire.\n\nBefore her was a lever, simple and relatively unassuming. In any other context, pulling it would be inconsequential. Here, however, this was the lever of fate. Throwing it would usher in a new paradigm, activating the Commonality and linking the entire consensus of the nation. Millions of minds, united in common cause for democracy.\n\n “Whenever you’re ready, ma’am.”\n\nShe glanced back at the scientist, who gave her a knowing look. With a deep breath, she reached out, gripped the metal switch and threw it down.\n\nIn an instant, the whole of the tower erupted in blue light. Ticker tape recorders began rattling off sheets of punch-card data. A great sigh blew through the crowd as their implants connected with the relay.\n\nOne by one, a great wave swept the whole of Eurasia as each tower threw their own switch. A wave of progress carried from the Baltic to the Black Sea to the Siberian wilds. Zofia felt her own implant kick on, a slight warmth manifested behind her right ear, just beneath the skin.\n\nNearby, a kinegram monitor snapped to life. Amber hue bathing the room like a polluted sunset. A single word appeared on screen.\n\n"
  inventorwar.28.a:0 "“Query?”"

  inventorwar.29.t:0 "The Woman in White"
  inventorwar.29.d:0 "From the hospital bed, Nikola Tesla watched the tower erupt in light. An enormous beacon, stretching into the clouded sky. A nurse stepped in, set a tray of food down near his bed, and headed for the door. Behind her ear, Tesla spotted a tiny blinking light. The woman paused, silhouetted in the electric glow of the hallway.\n\n“You should be proud, Mr. Tesla.”\n\nHe stared at the dinner tray, eyes glued to the synthetic meat and off-color onions. Leaning forward, he nudged the food around with a fork. The nurse sighed, then walked off to continue passing out trays.\n\nA moment later, the light was blocked by another woman. The fork dropped from his hand and clattered to the ground. A woman in a white dress was standing there.\n\nHis wife.\n\nLilya smiled and stepped across the room towards him; she moved as if in water, as if gliding through an unseen membrane. The movements were both fast and slow at the same time. Everything about her was paradoxical. In an instant, she was at his bedside. In a hundred thousand hours, she was at his bedside. A few seconds stretched into the infinite.\n\nShe sat down, a deathly cold hand grasped his. Lilya’s smile waned as she ran a hand over his pallid face.\n\n“You know,” she said, “I wanted Zofia to be an artist.”\n\nThe two shared a quiet, somber laugh.\n\n“I’m sorry, I should have-“\n\nLilya shook her head."
  inventorwar.29.a:0 "“It’s alright. We don’t have time for regrets anymore.”"

  inventorwar.30.t:0 "Mother and Son"
  inventorwar.30.d:0 "Again, Zofia watched a parent be interred to the Earth. A thick mix of snow and industrial material sprinkled from the sky above as the last dirt covered Nikola Tesla’s grave. A fog descended over Saint Petersburg, wind kicking up off the coast. Zofia pulled the collar of her black coat up and shuddered against the frigid breeze. The service itself was small, relatively speaking. After the fact, nearly a hundred people filed through to pay their respects. Scientists, entrepreneurs, a handful of Teslaworks executives, the expected crowd.\n\nOne man broke off from the group, however, and approached her. A portly fellow in a long coat and suit, an ushanka fit only for a tourist covering his withered head. He reached out with a pair of oversized mitts; a sullen smile across his face.\n\n“Miss Tesla, is it?”\n\nZofia shook his hand, puzzled.\n\n“I don’t believe we’ve met, Mr?”\n\n“Edison, Charles Edison.”\n\nShe raised an eyebrow. He laughed.\n\n“I know, your father hated mine. That’s why I came out all this way, express my condolences. Bury the hatchet.”\n\nCharles glanced down at the grave. It was modest, just a simple epitaph and a name. He turned his attentions back to Zofia, who continued to eye him suspiciously. Edison wiped the industrial snow off his face, coughing as he did.\n\n“You ask me, if my pop had just paid yours what he owned, this whole bloody rivalry could’ve been avoided.”\n\nEdison sauntered off, calling back to her as he headed towards his car.\n\n“You ever get tired of the snow, give me a call. I’d hate to see a woman of your talent be wasted.”\n\n[get_ending_text_1]"

  inventorwar.31.t:0 "Feedback Loop"
  inventorwar.31.d:0 "The city was in utter chaos. Germans and British fought running battles through the Saint Petersburg streets. The winter palace was besieged by an army of anarchists, the city center was in flames.\n\nAbove it all was the Tesla Relay Tower, and within sat Zofia Tesla. The British technicians fussed over the machinery, picking and prodding at it while she sat handcuffed to a pipe. One of the officers marched in, barking orders at the soldiers.\n\n“Well, what are you all waiting for? Shut this thing down!”\n\nZofia screamed, pulling at her restraints.\n\n“Wait! You don’t understand! This isn’t a communications tower! If you shut the relay down-“\n\nA soldier cracked her across the face with the back of his hand. She tasted blood and through blurred vision, watched in horror as the officer marched over to the console. In a fluid motion, he grasped the override lever and slammed it into the off position.\n\nIn an instant, Zofia’s mind felt as if it were on fire. She screamed, along with everyone else in the complex. Across Saint Petersburg, millions of Russians who weren’t already dead or dying dropped where they stood. Without the tower to manage the implants, thoughts flushed through the minds of everyone in the city, to the point that it was difficult to tell whose thoughts were whose.\n\nSoldiers turned their weapons on each other or themselves, within thirty minutes thousands had taken their own lives to escape the deafening cacophony of uncontrolled thought. The British and German soldiers could only watch, helplessly, as an entire city descended into madness.\n\nZofia, for her part, used her free arm to drive her nails into the skin behind her ear. With a hefty pull, she ripped the neural implant from her head and tossed it to the ground. She writhed on the floor, seizing and thrashing as the soldiers attempted to restrain her further. In a matter of moments, she was dead, body twisted into a warped facsimile of a human.\n\nWith the central relay down, the rest soon followed. A wave of inconceivable madness swept the entirety of Eurasia, sparing only those luddites who had avoided the implants."
  inventorwar.31.a:0 "This is going to complicate things."

  RUS_reconciliation_text_1:0 "His grip loosened, she guided the hand back to his chest where it sat, limply. Zofia looked towards the window, watching a fleet of zeppelins pass by.\n\n“I spent so many years thinking about what I’d say to you. How much you hurt us, hurt mother. You were never there. My entire life, I spent expecting one day to see you, and when we finally meet you’re one foot in the grave.”\n\nA morbid chuckle escaped her lips. Her father’s eyes watched her; tired, dull eyes that had seen far too much for one man. She looked down at nothing in particular, thoughts plunging into the fetid wound her father had left in her soul. Finally, nearest the bottom of all the heartache, was one last mote of something. Love, maybe? No, something different.\n\n“I forgive you. I shouldn’t, but-“ she choked on her words.\n\n“Since we’re here, taking account of things. I forgive you. I can’t let you go thinking I hated you. I can’t bring myself to do that to you.”"

  RUS_ending_text_1:0 "Zofia stood by the grave for a long time, feeling the Baltic air across her face. Slowly, the blackened snow began to bury the graves. Lilya and Nikola Tesla’s names vanished in a sea of muddy off-white. She turned, seeing Viktor playing on a tree branch by the graveyard fence. Beyond him, a vast line of graves stretched off into the horizon. She watched him play, the little implant blinking behind his ear as he tossed around snow.\n\nA brief pang of doubt struck her mind as she looked out over the city. The Tesla Tower loomed like a monolith over Saint Petersburg. Her family name was emblazoned in bright lights; a gaudy, self-indulgent monument to the company’s avarice.\n\nHer implant buzzed, and just like that the thought dissipated. No, she wasn’t ashamed. She was proud of the work she’d done. Proud of the empire she served.\n\nShe wanted to cry, to scream, to dig her fingers behind her ear and rip the implant out.\n\nThe implant buzzed once more, more forceful this time.\n\nZofia Tesla’s face curled gradually, painfully, into a smile.\n\nShe was afraid, and then she wasn't."
