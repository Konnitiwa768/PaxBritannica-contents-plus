  inventorwar.1.t:0 "The Child of Light"
  inventorwar.1.d:0 "The Edison Imperial Electric Exposition was a place not known for tact or subtlety.\n\nEnormous plasticine lightbulbs flanked each side of a vast stage, while showgirls twirled about beneath the flickering bulbs of the press corps. Scandelously clad waitresses toured through the crowd, handing out cocktails and cigars to the backing of a booming live jazz band. Amidst it all, at center stage, stood arguably one of the most powerful men on Earth.\n\nCharles Edison flashed the crowd a smile, piping cigar in hand as an aide handed him a microphone, and for just the briefest moment it seemed the whole world stopped for him alone. The band eased down, the crowd went quiet, a single light shown down on the stage.\n\n\"Now folks, I gotta tell ya, was that not the most fantastic show on telescreen?\"\n\nA pause for the applause, naturally.\n\n\"See though, the glitz and the glam, that's not what this company is really about. It's about building a better future, today. We are, in the year of our lord nineteen thirty three, on the verge of things thought impossible a hundred years ago. We've banished want across the entire Sahara Green Belt, we've bridged the world with the telescreen, but it's important to never lose sight of the most important thing, and that's changing lives.\"\n\nEdison, letting his smile drop for a moment, glanced over the crowd. He had them on the line, and now all he needed was to reel em' in.\n\n\"I've brought on a very special guest to speak with all of you tonight, and I hope her words will affect you as much as they've affected me. She's one of the greatest success stories of the modern era, a woman dealt one of the worst hands you've ever seen, but she's perservered, and thanks to this company's advancements in hearing and sight implants, she'll be able to live a life far beyond the deal god gave her. I'd like to invite to the stage Miss Helen Keller!\"\n\nFrom the backstage emerged an aged woman, dressed simply and waving to the gathered press. Edison surrendered the stage, handing off the mic to Keller and standing back to watch his best advertisement sell augments like hotcakes. Just to be safe, though, he made sure the cameras got a good view of the ocular implants. He needed to get his money's worth out of that tech, lord knows the R&D costs alone nearly bankrupted a few departments. Could you really put a price on curing blindness, though?"
  inventorwar.1.a:0 "Especially when it'll make so much damned money?"

  inventorwar.2.t:0 "The Child of Darkness"
  inventorwar.2.d:0 "If you were to look at Teslagrad, you might think it little more than a moldering industrial park, increasingly buried in the dust of the Central Asian Uplands. The unassuming ruins, one might think, were just the leftovers of an oil refinery or perhaps a military outpost. One would be forgiven for not knowing that at one point, this was a place where wonders were born.\n\nNikola Tesla, the man who created the modern world, was pulling up cabbages. The scruffy, shuffling elderly man hardly resembled the man who had ushered in the Second Renaissance. All the virulence had seemingly been struck out of him and like a shivering automaton, he pulled up cabbages and quietly tossed them in a basket. All around him stood monoliths, vast research labs packed with equipment that had cost billions, and all of it left to dry rot in the Kazakh sun. The crumbling buildings seemed to watch him, silently judging him with cracked glass window eyes, and the wind carried the whispers of his own self hatred. There was hardly a second that went by where he had peace and his mind wasn't flooded with terrible thoughts, screams, cries. Every day he stared at the noose he'd put up in his office and every day he called himself a coward when he couldn't kick the chair.\n\nFrom a makeshift dinner table, Tesla took in a bowl of cold cabbage soup and a glass of milk. He did this same routine each afternoon, each day, for the last decade. Cabbage and milk was the only thing he could bring himself to eat anymore, anything else, anything the Tsar's men had brought him, he couldn't touch. Immaculately produced cakes and caviar, all left to rot in a fridge somewhere because all he saw in it was blood, intestines and scorched skin. He was a prisoner, just as much to his mind as to Moscow, even if now he was little more than some fetid curiosity to be discussed in the tabloids. His genius had been both his creator and his damnation, and now the Empire kept him captive in a velvet cage for fear he'd sell his secrets to the world.\n\nIn the end though, he had no secrets left to give, no new genius to impart. All he was now was an old man, surrounded by cabbages and pigeons and the hulking ruins of his mistakes."
  inventorwar.2.a:0 "And at least this way, he'd never hurt anyone again."

  inventorwar.3.t:0 "Wake Up Call"
  inventorwar.3.d:0 "The letter had sat, untouched, on his desk for nearly a week. Tesla would walk past it in the morning, regarding it with quiet dread, before proceeding with his daily breakfast of soup and milk. Soup and milk, each day every day, and every time he thought he might just work up the courage to read the letter. The pink hued paper mocked him; it was Lilya’s favorite color. It was unquestionably from her. A letter hadn’t come from his wife in nearly two years. His stomach turned over, twisting in all manner of knots and binds thinking of what it might say.\n\nEventually, a morning came where the knots became too much to bear. He snatched it from the desk and tore it open like an animal; his hands trembled, as if the handwritten note were made of tungsten. He could feel his regrets, his failures creeping along his spine. The note was simple, the pen having been pressed hard into the paper.\n\n“Mother died yesterday. Should you decide to not be the coward I know you are, the funeral will be next week.\n\nBelow is enclosed the address.\n\n- Zofia”\n\nThe note fell to the dusty floor, followed shortly by Tesla himself.\n\nThe man who built the modern century laid, curled like a child, in an empty laboratory.\n\nSuddenly, a shot of pain went through him. His breath caught in his lungs as he tried to drag himself up to the desk. His arms were lead, locked up in agony as he fumbled around like a drunk. His hand wormed its way into the desk drawer and returned with a syringe; he ripped the cover off and slammed it into his neck. Tesla crumpled back to the floor, staring out the door of his lab into the moldering remains of Teslagrad.\n\nA woman was standing outside, clad in the brightest white dress he’d ever seen. One hand held a parasol, and the other a watch. Her face was obscured by an enormous summer hat; the same kind Lilya would wear in the garden back home.\n\nHe blinked and she was gone, not even shoe prints in the dust.\n\nAn hour later Tesla slowly clambered to his feet, drenched in sweat and head pounding. One wayward glance at the letter on the floor and he knew now what he had to do. In a moment, he tossed the rest of the nitro in his jacket and went for the door. He had the energy of a man possessed now, and there was only one way to make things right.\n\nHe was headed for St. Petersburg."
  inventorwar.3.a:0 "No time to waste."

  inventorwar.4.t:0 "Siberian Sunset"
  inventorwar.4.d:0 "Russia had changed, that much was evident from the train ride. He could have taken a luxury car, he had the rubles to afford one, but Tesla couldn’t enjoy that kind of pampering anymore.\n\nOf course, an Okhrana agent was on the train with him. He’d gotten used to the tails years ago. At least now they were getting paid to do something besides watch a depressive shut-in repeat the same routine for years.\n\nSlowly, the Kazakh countryside gave way to Siberian farmland. Old family farms interspersed with vast company agrocomplexes that stretched off for kilometers; the stench of modified cattle wafted through the cabin. Steel grain towers, as high as metropole buildings, loomed like obelisks. A few were emblazoned with a familiar name: “TESLA ELECTRICWORKS”.\n\nTesla shuddered and tried to relax in his seat; sleep didn’t come easy anymore. After an hour, he finally drifted off and the train was replaced with an extravagant sitting room. The fuzzy memory of a decade ago enveloped him. It was a quiet evening or, rather, as quiet an evening as one could get at the Winter Palace. Protestors shifted about outside the gates, shouting slogans and waving signs, their faces indistinct against the city.\n\nThe Tsar stood by the window and scoffed, turning to Tesla and shaking his head.\n\n“These people,” he said. “They think they know how to rule themselves, but look at how much chaos they’ve caused?”\n\nTesla didn’t respond, merely sitting with his head cupped in one hand and a newspaper in the other. It was the bulletin from Minsk; over a hundred dead. Russian Shock Troopers opening up on a crowd of protestors. Teslaworks weapons, of course, he could tell the make and model just from the blurry photographs. Alexander kept on, animated in his movements and frustrations.\n\n“But no, these Poles, these little Russians, these balts; they reject what we’ve built for them. They’d rather burn it all down than-“\n\n“Your majesty,” Tesla croaked, setting the paper on a nearby table. “I feel I have blood on my hands.”\n\nAlexander paused, glancing over the inventor as if taking stock. He scoffed, reached into his breast pocket and tossed Tesla a handkerchief.\n\n“Would you like to wipe them?”\n\nThe mocking tone of the Tsar echoed in his mind as he awoke."
  inventorwar.4.a:0 "No more sleep until the capital, then."

  inventorwar.5.t:0 "A Death in the Family"
  inventorwar.5.d:0 "Zofia’s mother was dead.\n\nShe’d known it was coming, prepared for it, steeled herself, thinking maybe it would soften the blow. It didn’t. She sat by the bedside, face buried in her hands and practically screamed in grief. Zofia reached out and snatched up her mother’s hand and clung to it like a life preserver. If she just held on long enough, maybe the warmth would come back, maybe her mother would rise and hold her, even just one more time.\n\nIt never happened.\n\nThe body remained inert; warmth slowly draining. Lilya’s jaw hung slightly ajar, her eyes glassy, like a wax simulacrum of an elderly woman. The blood settled and the warmth fled, and Zofia was left clutching a hand that now felt alien to her. This was no longer Lilya; it was merely an object that could once have been called her mother. From behind, a small hand tugged at Zofia’s coat.\n\n“Is grandma alright?”\n\nHer guts were heavy, twisting and folding on one another. With a single shaking hand, she pulled her son in close. A moment passed and the two were interrupted by a doctor.\n\n“Miss Tesla, if it’s alright I have a few papers I need you to sign.”\n\nZofia wiped her eyes and rose from the chair, taking the pen and paper and scribbling away at whatever legal nonsense the clinic needed to report a death. Midway through, she paused and glanced at the young man.\n\n“You wouldn’t happen to have an extra envelope, would you?”\n\n“Of course,” the doctor nodded. “Was there someone you’d like us to notify?”\n\nThe grief gave way to hate, and she practically spit in rage as she spoke."
  inventorwar.5.a:0 "“My father.”"

  inventorwar.6.t:0 "Arrival"
  inventorwar.6.d:0 "St. Petersburg was different than he remembered. The city just kept going and going, an endless labyrinth of industrial quarters and template apartment blocks whose dominance was only challenged by the Neva. The old city was mercifully untouched for the most part; the Russians had not embraced the British and American tendencies to entomb their own metropole.\n\nThe Mariinsky shadowed him as he stepped out of the station, cold wind blowing in off the Baltic sea. There was an immense noise to every aspect of the city now; Tesla had grown far too accustomed to the oppressive silence of the steppe. Everywhere he looked he could see throngs of people, moving so quickly as to become a blur of faces, indistinguishable from one another save the occasional odd detail.\n\nHe glanced at the address, steeled himself, and began to walk.\n\nTesla traced the steps from the station, trying to string together some kind of plan. The funeral would not be for a few days; he hoped that perhaps he could track Zofia down before then. He slouched down on a bench by the roadside, mulling over ideas. He didn’t know if she was still using his last name, he didn’t know where she worked, he could only assume she still lived in the city based on the address.\n\nHe caught a glimpse of movement from the corner of his eye.\n\nAcross the street, a man sat down on a bench and unfolded a newspaper. He looked uncomfortable, shabbily clothed but not as though he were a vagrant. He looked like a rich man’s approximation of how a vagrant might dress. The man shuffled the newspaper uneasily, stealing glances at Tesla and pretending to read while he took notes.\n\nAn Okhrana agent. They were still tailing him. He almost burst into laughter.Who better to ask then the agency that had been watching him for so long? He rose to his feet and started his way towards the man."
  inventorwar.6.a:0 "If anyone would know, they would."

  inventorwar.7.t:0 "Reunion"
  inventorwar.7.d:0 "“You’re certain this is the right place?”\n\nThe agent nodded; hands buried in his coat pockets. The tenement was a monolith of steel and concrete that stretched into the sky. A decade ago, Tesla would have thought it a marvel. Today, it was just one of a hundred, perhaps a thousand skyscrapers that loomed over the skyline. A canopy of wires hung overhead, scattering the setting sun into millions of shards of light. A skytrain rumbled overhead on the concrete bridge between the buildings.\n\nTesla tried the front door, but it was locked. An panel of lights and buttons to his right read off units; a few lights flickered. He resisted the urge to replace the bulbs and motioned for the Okhrana agent. The man sighed, dug around in his coat pocket and withdrew a notepad and an odd-looking key. He first scribbled on the notepad and tore it off the backing, shoving the crumpled paper in Tesla’s hands. The inventor let it unfurl in his hand, revealing a hastily written unit number as the agent shoved the key into a slot on the bottom of the panel. A quiet beep resounded, and the door unlocked. Tesla let a slight smile creep across his face and extended his hand to the agent.\n\n“I appreciate this, truly, Agent-“\n\nThe man cut him off, waving off the handshake. Tesla’s smiled faded.\n\n“Yezhov”, he said before turning to leave, pausing to get one last jab in.\n\n“And remember, Mr. Tesla, we’re watching. You already disappeared once, best not to let it happen again, no?”\n\nAnd with that, the agent vanished into the crowd, leaving Tesla the arduous task of finding the unit on his own.\n\nAn hour went by before Tesla finally found the unit. Unit 451, on the fourteenth floor. He stood in front of the metal door for what felt like an eternity; the body was meat; he couldn’t bring himself to knock. The days of travel, the bluster, all of it died the instant he stood before that simple metal door. Could he bring himself to do it? What would she say? Would she say anything? Was it already too late?\n\nThe hypotheticals became irrelevant one-by-one as his arm raised, shaking, and a hand rapped on the door. It felt like a knock on the door of god. The reverberation hung in the air for a few seconds, giving the man just enough time to regret the decision before he heard a lock unlatch.\n\nHis daughter stood in the doorway, at first looking sullen, then terribly angry."
  inventorwar.7.a:0 "As if her body were not her own, Zofia stepped through the doorway, wound up her arm and proceeded to sucker punch her father in the face."

  inventorwar.8.t:0 "Father and Daughter"
  inventorwar.8.d:0 "The two Teslas sat in the dining room, the elder holding a steak to his blackened eye. Across the table, his daughter stared him down, her coffee going cold. An airship shuffled past the window outside, “TESLA ELECTRICWORKS” scrawled along the side in stark black paint. Anywhere he looked, he could spy his name stamped proudly on appliances and cars and zeppelins. A sensation creeped up his back, half shame and half pride, disgust at the company that bore his name and delight to see it so pervasive. His daughter’s voice cut off the rumination.\n\n“Why are you here?”\n\nHe cocked his head. Zofia rolled her eyes.\n\n“I didn’t think you’d actually show up” she said, dim eyes glancing to the coffee cup. “She asked for you before she died, you know, even near the end. I had to tell her you were on business.”\n\nNikola set the steak down and let out a deep sigh. For what felt like an eternity he tried to find the words. A million theories and simulacrums, and he couldn’t think of what else to say to his daughter.\n\n“I’m sorry,” he croaked. “After what happened, I couldn’t bear being here. I-“\n\nZofia ran her hands over her face, her rage barely disguised as Tesla fumbled through an apology ten years too late. She brought a hand up to stop him.\n\n“Whatever this is, whatever you thought you’d accomplish-“\n\nHer father cut her off; a hand clenched.\n\n“I don’t think I have much time, Zofia, and I don’t have anywhere else to stay.”\n\nHe leaned forward, trying to come up with the words. Years of isolation had not helped his lackluster social skills.\n\n“Just- please. Give me a chance to make things right.”\n\nZofia sighed, rose from the table and poured her cold coffee down the drain. In the other room, Victor slept, still out of classes on bereavement. As much as she hated him, did he still deserve a chance to see his grandson? She didn’t know, but looking back at her father, she found it hard to truly hate him. He was a husk, not the monster she’d painted for so many years, just another absentee father."
  inventorwar.8.a:0 "“You can stay here until the funeral, but after that I want you gone.”"

  inventorwar.9.t:0 "Grandfather and Son"
  inventorwar.9.d:0 "Daylight rose over Saint Petersburg, flowing down the streets between the skyscrapers. Nikola watched it from the balcony, his breath hovering in the air ahead like smoke. Overhead, an airship passed, horn blaring. Yet again, his name was emblazoned on the side. Anywhere he looked, he saw his name plastered. Tesla light fixtures, Tesla airships, Tesla train cars, Tesla coffee makers, his last name repeated ad nauseum until it no longer felt like a name but some kind of mantra. Few men could comprehend living in history, but for Nikola, his name, his legacy was interwoven into the very wire that powered this country.\n\nZofia rapped her hand on the door of the balcony and his daydreams vanished. She was dressed formally, carrying a briefcase and a thermos.\n\n“I have to head into work early, can I trust you to keep an eye on Viktor for a few hours?”\n\nHis brow furrowed; she rolled her eyes.\n\n“If you’re going to stay here, the least you could do is spend some time with your grandson.”\n\nStepping back inside, Tesla loomed over the child in the living room. The space was already cramped, but between the three, it felt unimaginably small. The child sat in front of a Kinegram box, gormlessly watching some kind of cartoon, headphones strapped to where they smushed his unkempt hair. Zofia scoffed, shaking her head as the cartoons faded into an advertisement for some kind of “action doll”; A handful of them sat nearby in various states of disrepair.\n\n“Viktor,” she said, peeling the headset off. The child groaned quietly, grasping fruitlessly while Zofia gently turned his head.\n\n“Why don’t you spend some time with your grandfather?”\n\nViktor looked Nikola over, cheerful face now inscrutable. It was as if the child had taken stock, and he had found the man before him wanting. Nikola fumbled to the ground, legs popping as he sat. The two continued to sit, Zofia finally breaking the stalemate and heading for the door. As it latched shut behind her, Tesla grasped one of the dolls and looked it over. A soldier, Russian most likely, in some kind of armored knight suit.\n\n“So, uh-“ he croaked. “You like, em, dolls?”\n\nThe child sneered, crossing his arms in protest."
  inventorwar.9.a:0 "“They’re ACTION figures, not dolls.”"

  inventorwar.10.t:0 "Lysenko v. Tesla"
  inventorwar.10.d:0 "As the crowd filed out, Zofia sighed and set the electrode cap aside. They’d planned on demonstrating next week, but with the Board of Directors in town early, she needed to seize the chance. The applause was a good sign, but what she needed was capital, more test subjects, a greater benefactor than her personal bank account. There was the company stipend, but she refused to touch it. Taking a handout from her absentee father’s company was a line she was, at least for now, unwilling to cross.\n\nThe unspoken presence of another drew her attention away from her thoughts. A man sat across from her in the lab, just barely out of sight. Her eyes fell on him and he rose, stepping out into the scant sunlight that shone through the windows above. A beady little man in a suit with a terrible combover.\n\n“Tesla,” he said, making only the slightest effort to disguise his distaste. Zofia’s nails dug into her desk.\n\n“What forced you out of your hole this time, Lysenko?”\n\nHe chuckled quietly.\n\n“I just wanted to see what all the buzz was about,” he strolled over to the desk, lifting the electrode cap and turning it over in his hands. Zofia watched him closely with a mix of disgust and fear. A part of her wanted to slap him, snatch it from his hands and drive him out of her lab. Another, more rational part knew she couldn’t, even with her last name she couldn’t get away with antagonizing Russia’s favorite freakshow director. Lysenko set the cap down and gave her a smile that could have eaten all the shit on Earth.\n\n“-and I’m not terribly impressed.”\n\nTesla leaned back, the creak of the office chair echoing through the lab like a gunshot. Lysenko’s beady eyes remained locked on hers, that stupid smile still scrawled across his face.\n\n“Well, when I get into the business of disfiguring animals, I’ll be sure to give you a call.”\n\nThe smile faded, Lysenko leaned forward, both hands on the desk.\n\n“You got funding for your little brain project because of your name, girl, but the Kremlin won’t fund these fantasy projects of yours.”\n\n“No, they fund your little fantasy projects,” she spat back, rising from the desk.\n\n“You might be able to impress the Tsar with your monster parlor tricks, sticking lungs and hearts into people, but what I can offer them is real, tangible changes.”\n\n“I make them better humans. What you’re offering them”, Lysenko sneered, “is to build a machine to make themselves redundant.”\n\nHe leaned back off the desk, headed for the door.\n\n“You want to make a machine to replace the government, and what after that Perhaps a machine to replace all of us? Subsume flesh to steel?”"
  inventorwar.10.a:0 "“Perhaps just a machine to replace you, Doctor.”"

  inventorwar.11.t:0 "Viktor"
  inventorwar.11.d:0 "An island of green in a sea of metal, the arboretum was encased in a thin plastic shell, adorned with fanned ventilators. The smog of the city flowed around it, held back by clogged filters. Nikola watched from a cheap metal bench as pigeons moved across the plasticine roof. He remembered when finding a park in Petersburg was as simple as walking down the street; now, he had to cross the complex and ride an elevator just to find this little slice of life.\n\nThe boy sat next to him, kicking his feet impatiently at the grass. Tesla, however, found himself increasingly lost in thought. When he first moved to Russia, the immensity of nature was manifest wherever he looked. Vast forests of aspens and pines stretched as far as the horizon in some places. He glanced down at a bed of flowers, planted upon hydroponic beds and organized neatly by type. In the forest, wildflowers grew and intermingled into a menagerie of color. Here, there could be no such disorganization. Man had planted his flag over nature and found its’ disharmony unacceptable.\n\n“Can we go now?”\n\nViktor’s voice broke the silence, snapping Tesla from his thoughts. He looked down at him, befuddled.\n\n“Go? We just got here.”\n\n“I can see trees on the screen whenever I want.”\n\nTesla cocked his head; a flock of pigeons scattered overhead as a passenger zeppelin blazed past. \n\n“Have you ever been out of the city?”\n\n“Sometimes we go to other cities.”\n\nThe old man sighed, looking away from the boy and back to the miniature forest that surrounded them. How long would a place like this last before it would be torn down to build more apartments? How long before there were no more places like this here, no more places like this anywhere? How long before a generation was raised entirely beneath a steel sky, concrete trees, rust and dust?\n\nOnce more, Viktor pulled him from his thoughts. The boy rose to his feet and tugged on Tesla’s jacket, motioning back towards the airlock.\n\n“We’re gonna miss my shows.”\n\nTesla rose from the bench, taking one more glance of the arboretum, then back at Viktor before they departed."
  inventorwar.11.a:0 "The kids aren’t alright."

  inventorwar.12.t:0 "Bad Dreams"
  inventorwar.12.d:0 "The streetlights of Budapest pierced through the windows of Tesla’s laboratory. Yet, when he looked out, the city was silent and dark. The ubiquitous streetlamps were swallowed in an ocean of black. Figures moved below, occasionally glancing up at him with faces he couldn’t make out. From behind, a familiar voice rose, young and filled with the vigor of a man without mistakes.\n\n“You failed them,” the voice said. Each syllable dripped with venom; words more snarled rather than spoken. “Three billion people, trillions of years, all to culminate in you, and you failed them.”\n\nA younger Tesla stood before him, indistinct. The Older Tesla found his eyes became fuzzy when he tried to look at the Younger, as though the memory rejected perception. It stepped forward, footsteps silent against the hardwood as it spoke.\n\n“The power to change the world and you deferred it, handed it off to kings and emperors, moneychangers, monsters.”\n\nThey were standing in a trench now, the stench of death and human waste conquering the senses like an invading army. He could feel vomit rising. The younger motioned around; mountains of corpses laid about, the sounds of battle somehow both deafening and distant. Somewhere, a man screamed for his mother while a bullet settled in his torn open belly.\n\n“This is your legacy, our legacy,” the Younger Tesla said. “In how many homes would an empty armchair be occupied, how many graves would be empty, if you had just stopped?”\n\nThe Younger Tesla pointed a blurred finger, face swirling and distorting into a maelstrom of features that defied description.\n\n“This is the world you crafted, the world we made, when we handed the Steele of Daedalus to a tinpot Tsar.”\n\nIt was impossible to tell, but he almost sensed a wicked smile in the swirling din of his younger self’s face.\n\n“And Zofia will make the same mistake you did.”\n\nTesla rose with a cry, the couch and sheets soaked in sweat. His throbbing head fell into his hands while the sound of the radiator kicking on masked his sobbing."
  inventorwar.12.a:0 ". . ."

  inventorwar.13.t:0 "New Morning, New Century"
  inventorwar.13.d:0 "An unwelcome morning came, light breaching in shafts through the slats in the apartment window. Tesla lurched out of bed in a daze; he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. Messy hair, eyes reddened and baggy, he looked half dead. The door behind him creaked as he stepped into the living room; Viktor and Zofia were already crowded around the kinescreen. Viktor, clearly bored, regarded the inventor with a disinterested stare. Zofia, on the other hand, rose to her feet as he entered.\n\n“The Tsar has been shot.”\n\nThe sentence took time to worm its’ way through the aging Tesla’s neurons. The Tsar? Alexander? No, no, it was Michael now wasn’t it? His befuddled expression was broken by the distant call of police sirens. Somewhere, not too close but not too far away, an explosion rang out. Zofia ran to the window, flicking the automated shutter switch. They hummed into place, shrouding the room in darkness as the three returned their attention to the kinescreen. The news broadcast had been replaced with an emergency tone. A white Russian eagle dominated the screen as a monotone voice read out instructions; it was difficult to tell if the voice was simulated or human.\n\n“Remain indoors, a curfew of 1800 hours is now in effect for Saint Petersburg. Groups of individuals greater than three are not to congregate outdoors until an all clear has been issued. An official statement from the acting Prime Minister will be issued shortly.”\n\nOutside, the sounds of piston-powered mechanica filled the air. A great din of truck exhaust and tank treads on pavement followed. A military industrial orchestra filled the streets of the capital in what seemed like a matter of moments."
  inventorwar.13.a:0 "Somewhere out in the distance, the unmistakable clatter of gunfire rang out."
